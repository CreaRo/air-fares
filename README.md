# air-fares

[Incomplete Project]
Scrapes/Uses APIs of online flight booking websites and returns the least price to travel from place A to place B on a given date.

The idea of this project came about when a friend and I were booking air tickets and wanted to know the least price offered by different flight booking websites. We found a couple of websites - (like [SkyScanner](https://www.skyscanner.co.in/)) that work along the same lines, but didn't quite like the results at that time.
